    <p>Adhi composed the song "Club le Mabbu le" in his first year of college.[17] When we asked how it developed, he recalled, "I grew up watching my mother and aunts just being traditional, and when I saw girls going to bars, I immediately wrote the lyrics of that track. And through my lyrics I am raising the debate over whether we are really changing as a society or are simply aping the West."[21] When Adhi was living in Chennai, he met Ma Ka Pa Anand, then an RJ at Radio Mirchi.[10] Anand allowed Adhi to perform Club le Mabbule on his radio show with beatboxer Bharadwaj Balaji (also known as Triple B).[9][22] The recording went viral, receiving over two million views within a week of its release on YouTube. Afterwards R√©my Martin, an international brand, was surprised by Adhi's determination and launched Hiphop Tamizha as an official brand.[9] "Club le Mabbule" later vaulted Hiphop Tamizha further into public view when it was criticised as portraying Tamil women in a negative light.[23]</p>
